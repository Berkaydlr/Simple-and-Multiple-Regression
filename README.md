Simple and Multiple Regression Analysis: Sample Project with Python
Introduction: This project aims to perform simple and multiple regression analyzes step by step using Python.
Data Preparation: The relevant data set for example, The relationship between television advertising and sales is prepared and missing data is cleaned.
Simple Regression Analysis: Examines the effect of a single independent variable on the dependent variable (for example, house prices are predicted by area).
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the created model is evaluated (metrics such as R-square, MSE can be used).
Multiple Regression Analysis: The effect of more than one independent variable on the dependent variable is examined.
Model Selection and Validation: Different regression models are compared and the most appropriate one is selected.
Conclusions and Progress: The results obtained are summarized and recommendations for future work are made.
This project is a guide for those who want to understand the basic concepts of regression analysis and apply them using Python.
